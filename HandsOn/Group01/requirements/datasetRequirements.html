  <h3>R1:  Data are in one of the selected smart city domains.</h3>
  <p>The dataset contains information about traffic accidents involving bicycles. This information has been collected and published by the Madrid City Council on its <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=20f4a87ebb65b510VgnVCM1000001d4a900aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default">Open Data Portal</a>.</p>
  <h3>R2:  Data are available as a CSV file.</h3>
  <p>The dataset is available in CSV format.</p>
  <h3>R3:  Data have an open license so they can be published.</h3>
  <p>The open data portal allows the reuse of this and other data sets for commercial and non-commercial purposes. For more information, you can consult the <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.3efdb29b813ad8241e830cc2a8a409a0/?vgnextoid=108804d4aab90410VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=b4c412b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default">Conditions of Use</a>.</p>
  <h3>R4:  Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations).</h3>
  <p>The data set includes the exact location where the accident occurred (coordinates, district and street), as well as the data of the driver involved and his positive/negative in the alcohol consumption test.</p>
  <h3>R5:  Documentation exists for the data (optional).</h3>
  <p>PDF documentation appears on the same page where the dataset was extracted. This documentation includes a description of the fields that appear in the dataset</p>
  <h3>R6. Data can come from multiple data sources (optional).</h3>
  <p>In this case, the main source of data is the Madrid Municipal Police, although the City Council also supports the veracity of this data. In addition, the portal also includes the dataset of police actions, as a way to complement this data.</p>
